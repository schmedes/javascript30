    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const copy = players;
    console.log(players, copy);
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // copy[1] = 'foo';
    //console.log(players, copy);
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const copy2 = players.slice();
    console.log(players, copy2);
    copy2[1] = 'foo';
    console.log(players, copy2);
    // one day
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copy3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(players, copy3);
    copy3[1] = 'foo';
    console.log(players, copy3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy4 = [...players];
    copy4[1] = 'foo';
    console.log(players, copy4);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
        name: 'John Doe',
        age: 45
    }
    // with Objects
    // and think we make a copy:
    const objectCopy = person;
    // objectCopy.age = 33;
    // console.log(person, objectCopy);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const objectCopy2 = Object.assign({}, person);
    objectCopy2.age = 33;
    console.log(person, objectCopy2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
